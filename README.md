# Deep model for 2nd Social Media Mining for Health Applications Shared Task at AMIA 2017

## Task1
Automatic classification of adverse drug reaction (ADR) mentioning posts. It is a binary classification.

In this task, our best model is ensemble the traditional machine learning approach (logistic regression) with deep learning model (CNN with attention). 

The [task1](https://github.com/sifei/2nd-Social-Media-Mining-for-Health-Applications-Shared-Task-at-AMIA-2017/tree/master/task1) folder contains the linear model and deep model we used for the shared task. The example of input file format also provided at the [data_sample](https://github.com/sifei/2nd-Social-Media-Mining-for-Health-Applications-Shared-Task-at-AMIA-2017/tree/master/task1/data_sample) folder.

## Task2
Automatic classification of posts describing medication intake. It is a three-class classification.

In this task, our best model is averaging ten deep learning models (CNN with attention). 

The [task2](https://github.com/sifei/2nd-Social-Media-Mining-for-Health-Applications-Shared-Task-at-AMIA-2017/tree/master/task2) folder contains the linear model and deep model we used for the shared task. The example of input file format also provided at the [data_sample](https://github.com/sifei/2nd-Social-Media-Mining-for-Health-Applications-Shared-Task-at-AMIA-2017/tree/master/task2/data_sample) folder.
